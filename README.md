# Solving-Formulas
This program does the follwoing:
1) Calculates the value of Result using the following formula

  Result = (( x /y*y*y) - z/ (a*a) + b)
2) read  the necessary inputs form the userL
  x, y, z, a, b
3) use as many sub functions as needed
  1) one sub-function for finding the cube
  2) one sub0 fucntion for finding the square
  3) one sub-function to find the numerator
  4) one sub function to find the denominator
